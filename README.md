# SOC-visionary

## Stuff Learnt From Assignments:

- learnt to process data using Python dictionaries and implementing Functions.
- Learned about loss functions, gradient descent, and backpropagation for optimizing neural networks

- Developed a K-means clustering algorithm from scratch , including data loading, center initialization, distance calculations, and visualization.

- Built and trained an ANN and CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.

- Implemented data loading, normalization, model definition, training loops.

- Visualized training loss and confusion matrices to assess model performance.

- Conducted experiments like adding dropout or trying different optimizers to compare performance



### Skills Acquired

- Able to create plots using Matplotlib.

- PyTorch model building, training loop implementation, performance evaluation, and visualization of results.

- Machine Learning: Implemented K-means clustering and neural network training loops from scratch, along with performance evaluation metrics.

## Challenges I faced

- Debugging training loops and handling large datasets required careful attention to tensor shapes and device management (CPU/GPU).
- Taking too much time to run the code

Experiments: Adding dropout in neural networks reduced overfitting, while optimizers like Adam converged faster than SGD in my experiments.
